                <p>Hi, I'm Rahul, a mobile application developer, living in New Delhi, India. Currently I spend my days working as iOS Developer with <a href="http://in.instantsys.com">Instant Systems Inc.</a> Previously I have worked with <a href="http://sportido.com">IDO Sport Pvt. Ltd</a> as iOS Developer, where I managed the development of full lifecycle of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/sportido-find-players-and-places-to-play-sports/id1116512491?mt=8">Sportido</a> iOS application from the scratch.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I graduated from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University where I studied B.Tech (IT) and got a first class degree. While I was at university I interned with <a href="http://www.greedygame.com">GreedyGame Media Pvt. Ltd</a> and SO Infotech Ltd. that helped me to further hone in my skills as a developer. In my final year at the university, I joined <a href="http://sportido.com">IDO Sport Pvt. Ltd</a> as iOS Developer, working alongside completing my graduation. After graduating, I continued working with <a href="http://sportido.com">IDO Sport Pvt. Ltd</a> as a Full Time Employee.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I’m extremely passionate about app development and design in all it’s forms. When not at work I'm usually working on a new project or learning about new things. Aside from development, I enjoy spending time in reading, watching movies and series & hanging out with friends.</p>
